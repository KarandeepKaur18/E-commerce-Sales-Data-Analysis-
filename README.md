# E-Commerce Sales Analysis 🚀

This is my first end-to-end data analytics project. I analyzed 12 months of e-commerce sales data to find actionable insights using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### The Process

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Merged 12 separate CSVs into one master DataFrame using Pandas.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Cleaned and prepped over 185,000 rows, handling missing values (NaNs), data type errors, and duplicate headers.
3.  **Feature Engineering:** Created new columns for 'Sales', 'Month', 'City', and 'Hour' to enable deeper analysis.
4.  **Analysis & Visualization:** Used Pandas (groupby) and Matplotlib to answer key business questions.

### My 3 Key Insights

1.  **Best Month for Sales: 📈**
    December was the top-performing month, likely due to the holiday season.
    *(You can even add your chart here by dragging/dropping it into this text box!)*

2.  **Best Time for Ads: ⏰**
    The data shows two major peaks in orders—around 11 AM and 7 PM. This suggests the best times for marketing.

3.  **Top Product Pair: 🛒**
    The most frequently sold-together items were ('iPhone', 'Lightning Charging Cable'). This is a clear opportunity for product bundling!

### Next Steps

I plan to use this clean dataset to build a predictive model to forecast future sales.
